## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Angular v18](https://angular.dev/) - Angular v18

### What I learned

For this project I have learned more about SCSS mixins. It is a simple project that uses
Angular 18, a bit of an overkill but I wanted to ger more practice with its latest
features in version 18.

The code that I am proud of implementing was the responsive mixin
that with a few modification could many any property responsive with one function.

See below:

```scss
@mixin responsive($property, $value-mobile, $value-laptop: none, $value-desktop: none) {
  #{$property}: $value-mobile;

  @if ($value-laptop !=none) {
    @media (min-width: $width-laptop) {
      #{$property}: $value-laptop;
    }
  }

  @if ($value-desktop !=none) {
    @media (min-width: $width-desktop) {
      #{$property}: $value-desktop;
    }
  }
}
```

```scss
.blog-card {
  &__image {
    display: block;
    height: 200px;
    @include mix.responsive(scale, 1.2, 1);
  }
}
```

### Continued development

As I continue going through the learning path of Frontend Mentor, I will continue explore
more SCSS features. I will so implement more semantic and best practices when it comes to
naming conventions and HTML elements.

### Useful resources

- [Angular Signal](https://angular.dev/guide/signals) - Angular Signals is a system that granularly tracks how and where your state is used throughout an application, allowing the framework to optimize rendering updates.
- [SCSS Mixins](https://sass-lang.com/guide/#mixins) - A mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site. It helps keep your Sass very DRY. You can even pass in values to make your mixin more flexible.

The code may not be perfect compared to my sensei @jonasschmedtman but I need to thank him because he has shown me the ropes and now I am a confident web
designer. Another important instructor is @MaximilianSchwarzm√ºller in Udemy.
